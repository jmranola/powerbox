                            <p>PowerBox leverages AWS server to its storage data. AWS was made up of encryption components to protect your files when uploaded to the server. The first component is the encryption method which conceals file data using a cryptographic algorithm. The second one is the KMI or Key Management Infrastructure. It has two subcomponents: the key storage and the management layer. The former protects the plain text keys while the latter is responsible for protecting keys by using an HSM or hardware security module to protect users from unauthorized use. A software-based authorization layer controls who can administer the HSM and which users or applications can use which keys. </p>
