                    <p class="subtitle">The idea of PowerBox came up to mind when receiving a request from technical support team. During daily operation in Salesforce.com, they often request customers to upload logs or specific files for debug use. However, these kind of logs are usually large files which exceed Salesforce limit per attachment. Therefore, we try to build a cloud storage space to provide them channel and place to communicate with customers and thatâ€™s where PowerBox plays its role.
